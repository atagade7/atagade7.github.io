I am an Economics PhD student at LSE, where I work on innovation, labor, organizations and networks. I am associated with the economics of innovation research group at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/economics-innovation-lab) and [Coll√®ge de France](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/centre-de-recherche-sur-economie-de-innovation), and with Center for Economic Performance ([CEP](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/)) at LSE.

I also help run the LSE Economics Applicant Mentoring Programme (AMP), about which you can find more [here](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/study/research/applicant-mentoring-programme).

I am always open for a chat about research and new ideas, so please feel free to reach out!
